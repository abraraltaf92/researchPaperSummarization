P03-1028.txt,"Soder- land (1999) and Chieu and Ng (2002a) attempted machine learning approaches for a scaled-down version of the ST task, where it was assumed that the information needed to fill one template came from one sentence only."
P03-1028.txt,"The task we tackle is considerably more complex than that of (Soderland, 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2002a), since we need to deal with merging information from multiple sentences to fill one template."
P05-1045.txt,Chieu and Ng (2002) propose a solution to this problem
P05-1051.txt,"(Borthwick, 1999) made a second tagging pass which uses information on token sequences tagged in the first pass; (Chieu and Ng, 2002) used as features information about features assigned to other instances of the same token.Recently, in (Ji and Grishman, 2004) we pro posed a name tagging method which applied an SVM based on coreference information to filter the names with low confidence, and used coreference rules to correct and recover some names."
