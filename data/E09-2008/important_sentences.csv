reference_5,"The compiler allows users to specify finite-state automata and transducers incrementally in a similar fashion to AT&T’s fsm (Mohri et al., 1997) and Lextools (Sproat, 2003), the Xerox/PARC finite- state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) and the SFST toolkit (Schmid, 2005)."
reference_12,These may be useful for someone wanting to build a separate GUI or interface using just the existing low- level functions.
reference_17,"Retaining backwards compatibility with Xerox/PARC and at the same time extending the formalism means that one is often able to construct finite-state networks in equivalent various ways, either through ASCII-based operators or through the Unicode-based extensions."

reference_46,"However, this on-the-fly minimization and determinization can be relaxed, and a Thompson construction method chosen in the interface so that automata remain non-deterministic and non- minimized whenever possible—non-deterministic automata naturally being easier to inspect and analyze."
reference_49,"Table 2 shows a comparison with some existing toolkits that build deterministic, minimized automata/transducers."
reference_51,"For general usage patterns, this advantage is not quite as dramatic, and for average use Foma seems to perform comparably with e.g. the Xerox/PARC toolkit, perhaps with the exception of certain types of very large lexicon descriptions (>100,000 words)."
