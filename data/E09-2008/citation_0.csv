"The compiler allows users to specify finite-state automata and transducers incrementally in a similar fashion to AT&T’s fsm (Mohri et al., 1997) and Lextools (Sproat, 2003), the Xerox/PARC finite- state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) and the SFST toolkit (Schmid, 2005).",3.1742331540551745,reference_5
"Retaining backwards compatibility with Xerox/PARC and at the same time extending the formalism means that one is often able to construct finite-state networks in equivalent various ways, either through ASCII-based operators or through the Unicode-based extensions.",3.1918247897714465,reference_17
