"By contrast, the Troll system described in this paper has an etfeetive algorithm f<>r deciding well-formedness, which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure, Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labelled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph (that is, they differ only in their node labellings) a disjunctive resolved feature structure.",2.672325076615856,reference_66
