"well-typable iff the feature structure subsumes a well-typed feature structure, in ALl.:, type infereneing is employed to ensure that all feature structures are well-typable--in fact, all feature structures are well typed.",2.2025562475113443,reference_61
"By contrast, the Troll system described in this paper has an etfeetive algorithm f<>r deciding well-formedness, which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure, Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labelled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph (that is, they differ only in their node labellings) a disjunctive resolved feature structure.",2.3268575867891794,reference_66
"We write fS, ~vf8 and 'D~.)c$ for the collections of feature structures, resolved feature structures and disjunctive resolved feature structures respectively.",2.458199607540267,reference_67
