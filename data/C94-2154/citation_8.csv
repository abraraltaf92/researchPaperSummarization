"APPROPRIATENES S CONDITIONS A very important property of the class of DRFS is that they are closed under unification, i.e., if F and F'E DRFS then F U F' E DRFS.4 Given this property, it would in principle he possible to use the disjunctive resolved feature structures in an implementation without any additional type inferencing procedure to maintain satisfiability.",2.5571544814583524,reference_82
"Let type resolution be the total function R:->DRFS such that R(F) is the set of all resolvants of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions, King [13] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R(F) 0.",2.636344205755449,reference_69
"well-typable iff the feature structure subsumes a well-typed feature structure, in ALl.:, type infereneing is employed to ensure that all feature structures are well-typable--in fact, all feature structures are well typed.",2.710207085200894,reference_61
