reference_66,"By contrast, the Troll system described in this paper has an etfeetive algorithm f<>r deciding well-formedness, which is based on the idea of efficiently representing disjunctive possibilities within the feature structure, Call a well-typed feature structure in which all nodes are labelled with species a resolved feature structure and call a set of resolved feature structures that have the same underlying graph (that is, they differ only in their node labellings) a disjunctive resolved feature structure."
reference_67,"We write fS, ~vf8 and 'D~.)c$ for the collections of feature structures, resolved feature structures and disjunctive resolved feature structures respectively."
reference_69,"Let type resolution be the total function R:->DRFS such that R(F) is the set of all resolvants of F. Guided by the partition and all-or-nothing conditions, King [13] has formulated a semantics of feature structures and developed a notion of a satisfiable feature structure such that F E FS is satisfiable iff R(F) 0."

reference_74,type inferencing fails?
reference_82,"APPROPRIATENES S CONDITIONS A very important property of the class of DRFS is that they are closed under unification, i.e., if F and F'E DRFS then F U F' E DRFS.4 Given this property, it would in principle he possible to use the disjunctive resolved feature structures in an implementation without any additional type inferencing procedure to maintain satisfiability."
reference_83,"It would, of course, not be very efficient to work with such large disjunctions of feature structures."
