The strategic lazy incremental copy graph unification method is a combination of two methods for unifying hmture structures.
One, called the lazy incremental copy graph unification method, achieves structure sharing with constant order data access time which reduces the cequired memory.
Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying.
Pereira's structure sharing FS unification method can avoid this problem.
This method is called the strategic ij!~crementaI copy graph unification method (the SING unification method).
Incremental Copy Graph Unification PROCEDURE Unify(node1, node2) node1 = Dereference(nodel).
The LING unification procedure uses a revised CopyNode procedure which does not copy structures immediately.
Method In a system where FS unification is applied, there are features whose values fail relatively often in unification with other values and there are features whose values do not fail so often.
That is, the SING unification method applied in an analysis system uses the failure tendency information acquired by a learning analysis process.
By using learned failure tendency information, feature value unification is applied in an order that first treats features with the greatest tendency to fail.
(2) Number of features FSs have: if each FS has only a small number of features, the efficiency gain from the SING unification method is small.
The strategic lazy incremental copy graph (SLING) unification method combines two incremental copy graph unification methods: the lazy incremental copy graph (LING) unification method and the strategic incremental copy graph (SING) unification method.
