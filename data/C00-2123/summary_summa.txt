In Section 3, we introduce our novel concept to word reordering and a DP-based search, which is especially suitable for the translation direction from German to English.
For the translation model Pr(fJ 1 jeI 1), we go on the assumption that each source word is aligned to exactly one target word.
The alignment model uses two kinds of parameters: alignment probabilities p(aj jaj􀀀1; I; J), where the probability of alignment aj for position j depends on the previous alignment position aj􀀀1 (Ney et al., 2000) and lexicon probabilities p(fj jeaj ).
To explicitly handle the word reordering between words in source and target language, we use the concept of the so-called inverted alignments as given in (Ney et al., 2000).
Restrictions We compare our new approach with the word reordering used in the IBM translation approach (Berger et al., 1996).
A procedural definition to restrict1In the approach described in (Berger et al., 1996), a mor phological analysis is carried out and word morphemes rather than full-form words are used during the search.
Depending on the threshold t0, the search algorithm may miss the globally optimal path which typically results in additional translation errors.
In the last example, the less restrictive IbmS word reordering leads to a better translation, although the QmS translation is still acceptable.
In this paper, we have presented a new, eÆcient DP-based search procedure for statistical machine translation.
Future extensions of the system might include: 1) An extended translation model, where we use more context to predict a source word.
