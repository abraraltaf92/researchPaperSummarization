The algorithm is based on a graph model representing words and relationships between them.
Sense clusters are iteratively computed by clustering the local graph of similar words around an ambiguous word.
In section 2, we present the graph model from which we discover word senses.
Section 3 describes the way we divide graphs surrounding ambiguous words into different areas corresponding to different senses, using Markov clustering (van Dongen, 2000).
The word sense clustering algorithm as outlined below can be applied to any kind of similarity measure based on any set of features.
To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs, we use a cluster algorithm for graphs (Markov clustering, MCL) developed by van Dongen (2000).
Usually, one sense of an ambiguous word w is much more frequent than its other senses present in the corpus.
This is achieved, in a manner similar to Pantel and Lin's (2002) sense clustering approach, by removing c's features from the set of features used for finding similar words.
In our simple model based on noun co-occurrences in lists, step 5 corresponds to rebuilding the graph under the restriction that the nodes in the new graph not co-occur (or at least not very often) with any of the cluster members already extracted.
The problem can be addressed by using word sense clustering to attune an existing resource to accurately describe the meanings used in a particular corpus.
