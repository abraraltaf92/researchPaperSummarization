D08-1032.xml,"A topic-sensitiveLexRank is proposed in (Otterbacher et al., 2005).As in LexRank, the set of sentences in a documentcluster is represented as a graph, where nodes aresentences and links between the nodes are inducedby a similarity relation between the sentences."
D08-1032.xml,Thenthe system ranked the sentences according to a random walk model defined in terms of both the inter-sentence similarities and the similarities of the sentences to the topic description or question.
