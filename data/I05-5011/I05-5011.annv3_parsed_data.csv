C08-1107.xml,This sparked intensive research on unsupervised acquisition of entailment rules (and similarly paraphrases) e.g.
C08-1107.xml,"(Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005)."
C08-1107.xml,The coverage of u by v is measured by
C10-2017.xml,"In the same way, most NLP systems like information retrieval (Sekine, 2005) or question answering (Duclaye et al., 2003), based on pattern recognition, can be improved by a paraphrase generator."
D12-1094.xml,"Data-driven paraphrase discovery methods (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pasca and Dienes, 2005; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Sekine, 2005) extends the idea of distributional similarity to phrases."
E09-1025.xml,"A number of automatically acquired inference rule/paraphrase collections are available, such as (Szpektor et al., 2004), (Sekine, 2005)."
I08-1070.xml,"To avoid the drawback, several linguistic clues, such as fine-grained classification of named entities and coordinated sentences, have been utilized (Sekine, 2005; Torisawa, 2006)."
J10-3003.xml,"As a later reﬁnement, Sekine (2005) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexicalized phrasal paraphrases for speciﬁc concepts represented by keywords."
J12-1003.xml,This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates (Lin and Pantel 2001; Sekine 2005; Szpektor and Dagan 2008; Yates and Etzioni 2009; Schoenmackers et al. 2010).
P06-2094.xml,We also proposed a method to find paraphrases in the context of two Named Entity instances in a large un-annotated corpus (Sekine 05).
P07-1058.xml,"Some existing entailment acquisition algorithms can add contextual constraints to the learned rules (Sekine, 2005), but most donâ€™t."
P07-1058.xml,"Many methods for automatic acquisition of rules have been suggested in recent years, ranging from distributional similarity to finding shared contexts (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005)."
P07-1058.xml,"Indeed, the prominent approach for evaluating the quality of rule acquisition algorithms is by human judgment of the learned rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005)."
P08-1078.xml,"Recently, several algorithms were proposed for automatically learning entailment rules and paraphrases (viewed as bidirectional entailment rules) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005)."
P09-2063.xml,"Similarly, (Sekine, 2005) improved information retrieval based on pattern recognition by introducing paraphrase generation."
P10-1124.xml,"This has led to active research on broad-scale acquisition of entailment rules for predicates, e.g."
P10-1124.xml,"(Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008)."
P11-1062.xml,"Thus, acquisition of such knowledge received considerable attention in the last decade (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2009; Schoenmackers et al., 2010)."
P11-1109.xml,We agree with Sekine (2005) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases.
P12-1013.xml,"Consequently, sub stantial effort has been made to learn such rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Szpektor and Dagan, 2008; Schoenmackers et al., 2010)."
P12-2031.xml,"The significance of inference rules has led to substantial effort into developing algorithms that automatically learn inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Schoenmackers et al., 2010), and generate knowledge resources for inference systems."
P12-2031.xml,"Some attempts were made to let annotators judge rule correctness directly, that is by asking them to judge the correctness of a given rule (Shinyama et al., 2002; Sekine, 2005)."
P13-1131.xml,"Following Sekine (2005), we clustered templates that share their main verb predicate in order to scale down the number of different predicates in the corpus and collect richer word co- occurrence statistics per predicate."
W12-4006.xml,Some existing paraphrase and entailment acquisition algorithms add constraints to the learned rules (e.g.
W12-4006.xml,"(Sekine, 2005), (CallisonBurch, 2008)), but most do not."
W12-4006.xml,"As for paraphrase, Sekineâ€™s Paraphrase Database (Sekine, 2005) is collected using an unsupervised method, and focuses on phrases connecting two Named Entities."
