J13-1007.txt,"Indeed, we have used it to solve the problem of parsing while recovering null elements in both English and Chinese (Cai, Chiang, and Goldberg 2011), and others have used it for the joint segmentation and parsing of Arabic (Green and Manning 2010)."
J13-1007.txt,"One possible solution to the unobserved word-sequence problem is a pipeline system in which an initial model is in charge of token-segmentation, and the output of the initial model is fed as the input to a second stage parser."

J13-1007.txt,"Recently, Green and Manning (2010) report on an extensive set of experiments with several kinds of tree annotations and refinements, and report parsing accuracies of 79% F1 using the Stanford-parser and 82% F1 using the PCFG-LA BerkeleyParser, both when assuming gold word segmentation."
J13-1007.txt,"The best reported results for parsing Arabic when the gold word segmentation is not known, however, are obtained using a pipeline model in which a tagger and word-segmenter is applied prior to a manually state-split constituency parser, resulting in an F-score of 79% F1 (for sentences of up to 70 words) (Green and Manning 2010)."
